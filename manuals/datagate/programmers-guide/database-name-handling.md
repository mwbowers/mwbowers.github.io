title: Database Name Handling
description: This document focuses on the methods and best practices for handling database names within applications, including naming conventions, case sensitivity issues, and strategies for avoiding naming conflicts.

DG for Visual Studio 2019 is adept at handling the standard "database name" conventions familiar to AVR programmers and users of tools such as DataGate Database Manager. A database name is simply a shorthand notation, redirecting the client-side engine to a set of client/server database connection parameters stored in the system registry. These registry entries can be accessed and manipulated with the [ SourceProfile](source-profile-class.html) object. **SourceProfile** provides the programmer with some of the functionality of DataGate Database Manager’s "Work with Database Names" option. The object constructor and methods [ Register](source-profile-class-register-method.html) and [Unregister](source-profile-class-unregister-method.html) are used to retrieve, persist, and delete respectively, database name registry entries.

The following example retrieves a database name called "Asna 400 db" (in the process of constructing the SourceProfile object), changes the user and password, and then saves the changes by calling Register. 

```cs 
  using ASNA.DataGate.Providers;
  SourceProfile AsnaDbName;
  AsnaDbName = new SourceProfile("Asna 400 db");
  AsnaDbName.User = "NewUser";
  AsnaDbName.Password = "NewPasswd";
  AsnaDbName.Register()
```

To discover the currently registered database names available for use in a program, use the [SourceProfile.GetNames](source-profile-class-get-names-method.html) static method. This method returns an array of strings as shown in the following example. This snippet of AVR code will print "*PUBLIC" and "User" database names registered on the machine where the code runs. 

```cs 
     Console.WriteLine( "*Public Database Names:" );
  Foreach Name(DbName) Collection(SourceProfile.GetNames(*True)) 
				Type(*String);
     Console.WriteLine( "  *Public\" + DbName );
  Endfor;
     Console.WriteLine( "User Database Names:" );
  Foreach Name(DbName) Collection(SourceProfile.GetNames(*False)) 
				Type(*String);
  Console.WriteLine( "  " + DbName );
  Endfor;
```

Console.WriteLine( " " + DbName ) Endfor <p> **SourceProfile** objects may be assigned to the [ AdgConnection.SourceProfile](adg-connection-class-source-profile-property.html) property to force a subsequent call to [ AdgConnection.Open](adg-connection-class-open-method.html) to use the SourceProfile’s connection parameters. Changing **AdgConnection.SourceProfile** has no effect on the database connection of an **AdgConnection** object in the *Open* state. Rather, **AdgConnection.SourceProfile** is used by the **AdgConnection.Open** method to initialize the database connection.
