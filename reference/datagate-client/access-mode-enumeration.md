Remarks

**AccessMode** defines flag values which can be used alone or combined to create a custom value to suit an application’s requirements for accessing a particular file. Many common combinations, such as ReadWrite and <span>RWCD</span>, are predefined by the enumeration.

The [AccessMode](file-adapter-class-access-mode-property.html) property of <span> **FileAdapter** </span> contains a value of AccessMode, which should be set prior to calling <span> **FileAdapter’s** </span>[Open](file-adapter-class-open-method.html), [ OpenNewAdgDataSet](file-adapter-class-open-new-adg-dataset-method.html), or [ OpenSimpleQuery](file-adapter-class-open-simple-query-method.html) to provide the requested access restrictions on the opened file.
