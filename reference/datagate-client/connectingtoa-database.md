The DataGate notions of "database name" (a registered client-side reference to a set of database connection parameters) and "database label" (the server-side identifier for database servers) are provided to help you identify and connect to a database.

The way to connect to a database is through the [ AdgConnection](adg-connection-class.html) object. The following code fragment creates an AdgConnection object and connects to a database referred to by the database name "ASNA Local DB".
<pre class="prettyprint">
        <span class="lang">
 **[C#]** 
        </span>
  AdgConnection Cx;
  Cx = new AdgConnection("ASNA Local DB");
  Cx.Open();</pre>
<pre class="prettyprint">
        <span class="lang">
 **[Visual Basic]** 
        </span>
  Dim Cx As AdgConnection
  Cx = New AdgConnection("ASNA Local DB")
  Cx.Open()</pre>
<pre class="prettyprint">
        <span class="lang">
 **[Visual RPG]** 
        </span>
  Dclfld Name(Cx) Type(AdgConnection)
  Cx = *New AdgConnection("ASNA Local DB")
  Cx.Open()</pre>

The first line declares a variable reference to an **AdgConnection** object. The second line uses the New clause to create an instance of the DCS AdgConnection class, which is assigned to the *Cx variable.* The constructor of the class accepts a string parameter which refers to a registered database name. The third line creates a connection to the database named in the constructor.
