For multi-format file access, reset the file to access a record of any format in subsequent operations (see [SetFormat](file-adapter-class-set-format-method.html)).
<pre>[C#]
 **public void ResetFormat();** </pre>
<pre>[Visual Basic]
 **Public Sub ResetFormat()** </pre>
<pre class="prettyprint">[Visual RPG]
 **BegSr ResetFormat Access(*Public)** </pre>
      <br />

## Exceptions

None.
## Remarks

By default, when accessing multi-format files, records of all formats are accessible. The **SetFormat** method of **FileAdapter** can be used to restrict access to only records of a certain format. The **ResetFormat** method is used to return the access mode to the default, non-format specific behavior.
## Examples

 * the best on average in January from 1998 to 2004. This example assumes
 * there are no customer numbers in the second format which are not found in the
 * first format, and that there are no years on record past 1998 to 2004.
 * We use the ResetFormat method to read from both formats, and
 * this gives us the ability to easy see the next customer's name before we
