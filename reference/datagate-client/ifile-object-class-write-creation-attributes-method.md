Remarks

The creation-time attributes of a file are metadata apart from the file definition, describing certain operational characteristics the database provider enforces on the file object, such as the maximum number of members, and busy-wait times. This information is collectively expressed in DCS as a single XML content node (or element), named <code>&lt;fileCreateAttr&gt;</code> (see the XML schema). **WriteCreationAttributes** writes this content node to an XML stream, provided by *writer* . DCS obtains the creation-time attributes information for **IFileObject** from one of two sources:

- An existing database file, represented by **IFileObject** .
- The user program, via [
							ReadCreationAttributes](ifile-object-class-read-creation-attributes-method.html).

If the user program sets the creation-time attributes with **ReadCreationAttributes** , then **WriteCreationAttributes** dumps that information. If no creation-time attributes information has yet been obtained when **WriteCreationAttributes** is called, then **IFileObject** is assumed to reference an existing database file, and DCS attempts to query the database provider for the information. The only way to obtain the creation-time attribute information for an existing file is to call **WriteCreationAttributes** after constructing **IFileObject** , but before any call to **ReadCreationAttributes** on that **IFileObject** .

Note that if the creation-time attribute information of **IFileObject** was set with **ReadCreationAttributes** , any default attribute nodes not specified in the stream to **ReadCreationAttributes** will be explicitly defined in the stream written by **WriteCreationAttributes** , due to the schema validation function of **ReadCreationAttributes** . Thus the data written by **WriteCreationAttributes** may not be identical to the data read by **ReadCreationAttributes** , although both streams are semantically equivalent.

Further note that for **IFileObject** instances, [ IAdgObject.WriteXml](iadg-object-class-write-xml-methods.html) calls an internal version of **WriteCreationAttributes** to dump the creation-time attributes portion of the comprehensive XML description it generates. The internal version obtains the creation-time attributes information as previously described for this method.
