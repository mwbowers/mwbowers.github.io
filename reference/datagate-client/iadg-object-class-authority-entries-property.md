Remarks

Database providers may assign user authorizations to individual database objects. These authorizations are defined, per user or group profile, with the elements of the array value of **AuthorityEntries** . Each element of the array defines a single user or group profile, and its authority to the database object represented by **IAdgObject** (see **AuthorityEntry** ).

Reading the value of **AuthorityEntries** results in a database query to obtain the current authorization set for the object. The value of **AuthorityEntries** is cached in **IAdgObject** , such that reading the value after the first read returns the same value as the first. Any intervening changes to the database object's authorization set are not reflected by **AuthorityEntries** .

The database object's authorization set can be changed by assigning a value to **AuthorityEntries** . Changing the value of the array reference returned by **AuthorityEntries** has no effect on the database object, until the value is explicitly assigned back to **AuthorityEntries** .
