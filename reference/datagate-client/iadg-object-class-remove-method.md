Remarks

If **IAdgObject** is an instance of [IDirectory](idirectory-class.html), this method removes the library object it represents. The library cannot be removed if it is the root library or "/QTEMP", or if the library is not empty.

If **IAdgObject** is an instance of [ IFileObject](ifile-object-class.html), this method removes the file object it represents. The file cannot be removed if object dependencies exist for the file or any members it contains. If the file contains members, the members are also removed.

If **IAdgObject** is an instance of [ IMember](imember-class.html), this method removes the member object it represents. The member cannot be removed if object dependencies exist for the member.

To remove all records of a member, use the [ Clear](imember-class-clear-method.html) method.
