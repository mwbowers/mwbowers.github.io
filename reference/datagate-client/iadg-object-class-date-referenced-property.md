**DateReferenced** is a timestamp recorded by the database provider when the database object is referenced.
<pre>        <span class="lang">[C#]</span>
 **Public System.DateTime DateReferenced { get; }** 
      </pre>
<pre>        <span class="lang">[Visual Basic] </span>
 **Public ReadOnly Property DateReferenced As System.DateTime** 
      </pre>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
        <span class="lang">[Visual RPG]</span>
 **BegProp DateReferenced Access(*Public) Type(System.DateTime)
   BegGet** 
      </pre>

Property Value <p> **System.DateTime** . Read only. If **IAdgObject** was obtained via [IDirectory.Enumerate](idirectory-class-enumerate-method.html), the time the object was most recently referenced. 
## Remarks

Database providers record a timestamp of when a database object was most recently referenced by any session. In the current version of DCS, this timestamp is only reflected by **DateReferenced** when **IAdgObject** is obtained through the **IDirectory.Enumerate** method. The value of **DateReferenced** in instances constructed in any other way is **DateTime.Min** .
