## Property Value

[ASNA.DataGate.Common.ShareTypes](share-types-enumeration.html). Specifies concurrent access locking on the open file.
## Remarks

Applications may need to open a file for access exclusively to prevent access by other processes as data is being updated. Other applications may need to place no restrictions on concurrent access so that updates are immediately available in the open file. These requirements and others for sharing open file resources can be controlled with the <span> **ShareTypes** </span> property.

Set the value of **ShareTypes** to request the type of sharing required by your application. The access restrictions requested will be enforced by the database when the file is opened and until the file is closed. If the file cannot be opened with the level of sharing specified by <span> **ShareTypes** </span>, then the [ FileAdapter.Open](file-adapter-class-open-method.html) method will throw an exception.
## Examples

<pre>        <span class="lang">
 **[C#]** 
        </span>
  /* We open the file in order to delete all of its records. */

  /* Its generally good practice to make sure you have an exclusive lock
   * on a file that you are deleting all of the records from, but some
   * databases do not require it. */
  dbFile.OpenAttributes.ShareTypes = ShareTypes.Exclusive;
  AdgDataSet myDS = null;

  try

      dbFile.Open(myDS);
