Remarks

Use the **DeletedRecords** to examine the number of deleted records contained in an existing member object. For a count of active records use the [ActiveRecords](imember-class-active-records-property.html) property. 

The value of this read-only property is established only once in the lifetime of the **IMember** instance. Accesses of the property value after the first return a cached value that may not reflect intervening changes to the member object. To obtain a refreshed count, access the property value of a new instance of **IMember** .
