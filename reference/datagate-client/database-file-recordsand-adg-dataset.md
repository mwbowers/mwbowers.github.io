The .NET Framework provides the ( **DataSet** ) class as a general-purpose container for relational database data. **DataSet** objects offer many useful functions and are used throughout the framework and in data-centric components for access, update, and display. For example, **DataSet** objects can be bound to certain Windows forms controls at design-time. DCS builds on this foundation by sub-classing **DataSet** in its own [ AdgDataSet](adg-dataset-class.html) class. **AdgDataSet** effectively provides a bridge between the record-oriented access world of DataGate and AVR and set-oriented access methods. For a complete introduction to **DataSet** , please consult the .NET Framework documentation.

**AdgDataSet** objects consist of one or more ( **DataTable** ) objects. These **DataTables** represent each format of the file. The **DataTables** contain a collection of ( **DataRow** ) objects. In DCS, database file records are contained by **DataRow** objects. Field data of records are accessed by field name or through ( **DataColumn** ) objects, which reference the data and metadata of "columns" in **DataRow** objects. **AdgDataSet** adds methods and properties, such as [ ActiveRow](adg-dataset-class-active-row-property.html) and [PrepareRow](adg-dataset-class-prepare-row-method-main.html), to facilitate quick, familiar access patterns to the data in **AdgDataSets** .

**AdgDataSet** introduces the notion of an "active row" in a **DataSet** . This is the row which represents the database record to be accessed. For example, when a database record is read by one of **FileAdapter’s** read methods, the **AdgDataSet’s** **ActiveRow** property is set to reference the **DataRow** object added to **AdgDataSet** to contain the database record read.

Although DCS uses the facilities of a **DataSet** to represent record formats as a set of **DataTables** , **AdgDatSet** provides several methods which automate access to those tables with familiar record format specifications. [ DeleteRow](adg-dataset-class-delete-row-method.html), [AddRow](adg-dataset-class-add-row-methods.html), [ InsertRow](adg-dataset-class-insert-row-methods.html), and **PrepareRow** all provide direct access to **DataRow** objects in **DataTables** corresponding to a specific record format. 

As records are read from a file or added via **InsertRow** they accumulate in the **DataTable** for the format. The **ActiveRow** property only references the last record read - previously read/inserted records remain in the **DataTable** until they are explicitly removed, via **DataSet.Clear** or **DataTable.Clear.** To access or specify accumulated **DataRow** objects, the **DeleteRow** , **InsertRow** , and [SetActive](adg-dataset-class-set-active-methods.html) methods provide a *RRN* parameter. 

Note that accessing **DataRow** objects in **AdgDataSet** is not the same as accessing records in a database file. Database records can only be read, added, updated, and removed via [ FileAdapter](file-adapter-class.html) methods. **AdgDataSet** methods only access the in-memory representation of a database file's formats, not the underlying database file. **FileAdapter** methods use the **AdgDataSet** as a repository for database records read, added, and updated.
