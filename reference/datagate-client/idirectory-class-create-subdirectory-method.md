Parameters

<dl>
        <dt>
 *name* 
        </dt>
        <dd>

ASNA.DataGate.Common.dgException is thrown to signal normal procedural conditions, in addition to error conditions. The following table summarizes these conditions, and the corresponding value of the dgException.Error property.

Remarks

Use this method to create a library whose parent library is represented by **IDirectory** . Note that creating such a "sub-library" is a database provider-dependent function. For example, on System i databases, only the root library "/" (also known as QSYS) can contain other libraries. 

**CreateSubDirectory** returns a new instance of **IDirectory** , which represents the newly-created library. 

**CreateSubDirectory** creates libraries that are direct descendants of the library represented by **IDirectory** and therefore *name* must not contain a path name (i.e., no file separator characters such as "/"). Alternatively, to create a library in a random location in the database, use the [ AdgFactory.NewDirectory](adg-factory-class-new-directory-method.html) method, naming the location for the new library. Then call [IAdgObject.Create](iadg-object-class-create-method.html) on the returned **IDirectory** instance.
