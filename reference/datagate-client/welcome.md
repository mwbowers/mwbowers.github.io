The ASNA DataGate Component Suite 16.0 provides managed-code access to data and objects residing in DataGate for IBM i and DataGate for Windows (formerly, Acceler8DB) databases. Leveraging the strength of the .NET Framework, DCS for Visual Studio 2019 programs can be created using any .NET development language, including ASNA Visual RPG, Visual Basic, C#, and others. Data access mechanisms in DCS for Visual Studio 2019 support and enhance the System.Data namespace, including the DataSet model, while maintaining traditional DataGate record-level characteristics.

DCS for Visual Studio 2019 provides all of the same interfaces used by the Visual RPG compiler. The same powerful database engine used by Visual RPG is fully under your control, for use in any .NET language. Visual RPG for Visual Studio 2019 remains the language of choice for creating programs which access DataGate databases. However, with DCS for Visual Studio 2019, Visual Basic programmers and others can access data with nearly the same efficiency. Likewise, Visual RPG programmers will appreciate DCS for its object management capabilities.
