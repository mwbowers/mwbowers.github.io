| dgEsAS400ERROR | The database server encountered a system error. Details may be available via the SystemError and Text fields of dgException. |



## Remarks

Use the **Close** or **Dispose** methods to close a file opened by a previous call to one of the 'open' methods ([Open](file-adapter-class-open-method.html) and [OpenNewAdgDataSet](file-adapter-class-open-new-adg-dataset-method.html)). After a successful **Close** or **Dispose** call, the file may be subsequently reopened using the same **FileAdapter** object’s open methods.

**Dispose** and **Close** also release unmanaged resources associated with the **FileAdapter** , which allow the object to be safely finalized.
