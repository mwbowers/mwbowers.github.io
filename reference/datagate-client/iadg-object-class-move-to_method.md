Remarks

The **MoveTo** method moves a database object from one library to another. The source library is specified as the library containing the object represented by **IAdgObject** (named by the object path specified when the **IAdgObject** instance was created). The target library is specified by *LibraryPath* . Note that a member object cannot be moved from the file containing it.

Upon successful completion of the method, **IAdgObject** represents the object in its new location and the string returned by [ ToString](iadg-object-class-toString-method.html) method will reflect the new object path.
