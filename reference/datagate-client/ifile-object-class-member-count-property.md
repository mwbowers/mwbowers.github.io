Remarks

A database file object may contain zero or more database member objects. **MemberCount** is the number of member objects currently contained by a database file. The value of **MemberCount** is equal to the number of elements of the array value of the [ Members](ifile-object-class-members-property.html) property.

Currently, DCS retrieves the value of **MemberCount** from the database provider only once in the lifetime of **IFileObject** , and this value is returned each time the property value is accessed. Thus, the listed exceptions are never raised after the first successful access of the property value. To obtain a refreshed value for **MemberCount** , use a newly instantiated **IFileObject** instance referencing the same database file object.
