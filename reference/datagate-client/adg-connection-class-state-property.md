## Property Value

**System.Data.ConnectionState** . (set-only)
## Remarks

This property provides the ability to query the current state of **AdgConnection** objects.

Currently, **AdgConnection** supports two values of the **System.Data.ConnectionState** enumeration, Open and Closed. Open implies that a database connection currently exists under the control of the object. Closed signifies the absence of such a connection. **AdgConnection** objects are constructed in the Closed state.

The value of **State** will be set to Open by a successful call to the [Open](adg-connection-class-open-method.html) method. Likewise, the value will be set to Closed by [ Close Method](adg-connection-class-close-method.html) or [Dispose Method](adg-connection-class-dispose-method.html) calls.
