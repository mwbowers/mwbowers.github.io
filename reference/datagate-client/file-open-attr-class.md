A set of properties representing attributes of an open file.

For a list of all members of this type, see [FileOpenAttr Members](file-open-attr-class-members.html).

## Thread Safety

Any public static (Shared) members of this type are safe for multithreaded operations. Any instance members are not guaranteed to be thread safe.
## Remarks

<span> **FileOpenAttr** </span> objects are parameters passed to [FileAdapter](file-adapter-class.html) open methods ([Open](file-adapter-class-open-method.html), [ OpenNewAdgDataSet](file-adapter-class-open-new-adg-dataset-method.html), [OpenSimpleQuery](file-adapter-class-open-simple-query-method.html)) to invoke special access functionality in the opened DataGate file. This functionality includes:

- Network-level record blocking for high-performance read access.
- "Level-check" or DataGate file record format verification.
- Multi-process shared-access behavior.
- Other provider-dependent features of open files.

Note that **FileOpenAttr** inherits from System.Collections.Hashtable. The properties in **FileOpenAttr** are stored as key/value pairs in the **Hashtable** object where the key is a string containing the property name. For example, the value of the [ FileOpenAttr.BlockingFactor](file-open-attr-class-blocking-factor-property.html) property is alternatively referenced as **FileOpenAttr.Item("BlockingFactor")** . However, to enforce type safety, it is recommended to use **FileOpenAttr** get/set property methods to access values.

Upon construction, no properties are set in **FileOpenAttr** . Properties do not have values until they are explicitly set by your program. To determine if a particular property has been assigned a value, use the **ContainsKey** method of **Hashtable** . For example, if the **BlockingFactor** property has been assigned a value, **FileOpenAttr.ContainsKey("BlockingFactor")** will return a **True** value. To remove the value (and key) for a particular property use the **Remove** method of **Hashtable** .

**FileOpenAttr** members only influence the file when the object is passed into one of the open methods of **FileAdapter** . Setting properties of **FileOpenAttr** after the file has been opened has no effect on **FileAdapter** or the open file.
