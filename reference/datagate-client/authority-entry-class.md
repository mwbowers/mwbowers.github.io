## Thread Safety

Any public static (Shared) members of this type are safe for multithreaded operations. Any instance members are not guaranteed to be thread safe.
## Remarks

<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">AuthorityEntry</span> describes a user or group authorization to a database directory, member, or file. An instance of **AuthorityEntry** is usually one of a collection of authority descriptors for the database object, such as provided by the [AuthorityEntries](iadg-object-class-authority-entries-property.html) property of [IAdgObject](iadg-object-class.html).

[AuthorityEntry](authority-entry-class-authority-entry-constructors.html) constructors create a single authority descriptor. [ AuthorityType](authority-entry-class-authority-type-field.html) establishes the access capabilitities and limitations (add, change, exclude, management, etc.). [ UserName](authority-entry-class-username-field.html) establishes the user or group profile name associated with the access authority. [IsGroupAccount](authority-entry-class-username-field.html) indicates if the **Username** is a user or group profile.
