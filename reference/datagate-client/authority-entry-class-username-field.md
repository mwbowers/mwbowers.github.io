## Field
 Value

String. A user or group profile name known to the database provider.
## Remarks

An **AuthorityEntry** instance describes an authorization for exactly one profile name specified by **Username** . This may name a single-user profile known to the database provider, such as the user profile for the session (see also [SourceProfile.User](source-profile-class-user-property.html)). It may otherwise name a group profile or profile class as defined by the database provider (for example, "*PUBLIC", typically found in IBM i databases) The distinction between group and user profile names in **AuthorityEntry** is given by the [IsGroupAccount](authority-entry-class-username-field.html) field.

Many database providers honor the string "*Current", which is a generic specification for the user profile associated with the current session. When this is used for the value of **Username** , **IsGroupProfile** should be **False** .
