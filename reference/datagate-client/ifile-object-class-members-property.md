Remarks

**Members** allows the enumeration of the member objects of the database file represented by **IFileObject** . Each element of **Members** is an instance of [IMember](imember-class.html). The number of elements in **Members** is equal to the value of [ IFileObject.MemberCount](ifile-object-class-member-count-property.html). Modifying the **IMember** reference values of the elements of **Members** has no effect on the database file or its members. 

Currently, DCS retrieves the value of **Members** from the database provider only once in the lifetime of **IFileObject** , and this value is returned each time the property value is accessed. Thus, the listed exceptions are never raised after the first successful access of the property value. To obtain a refreshed value for **Members** , use a newly instantiated **IFileObject** instance referencing the same database file object.
