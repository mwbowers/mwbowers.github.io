A condition is an ANDed grouping of two through nine indicators that
must all be in effect (set off if N or ! is specified; set on if N
or ! is not specified) before the field or keyword is selected. You can
specify a maximum of nine indicators for each condition and nine
conditions for each field or keyword. You can also specify several
conditions for a field or keyword so that if any one of them is
satisfied, the field or the keyword is selected. This is called an OR
relationship
example: 1 & 2 & !3 | 44 & 55 | 60

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [IndicatorExpression](#indicatorexpressionstring)([String](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.string)) | Initializes a new instance of the  class with the specified expression string.

### IndicatorExpression([String](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.string))

Initializes a new instance of the  class with the specified expression string.

```cs
IndicatorExpression(String)
```

#### Parameters

| Type | Parameter name | Description
| --- | --- | ---
| [String](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.string) | expressionString | The expression string that represents the indicator expression.

## Methods

| Signature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Eval](#bool-evalchar--indicators)([Char\[\]](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.char)) | Evaluates the indicator expression against the provided set of indicators.

### bool Eval([Char\[\] indicators](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.char))

Evaluates the indicator expression against the provided set of indicators.


#### Remarks
This method evaluates the indicator expression, which is a string representation of a boolean expression involving indicators. The indicators are represented as an array of characters, where each character represents the state of an indicator (typically '0' for off and '1' for on).The indicator expression is evaluated in the context of the provided indicators, and the result of the evaluation is returned as a boolean value.Note that the indicator expression must be a valid boolean expression involving the indicators, and any invalid expression will cause an exception to be thrown when this method is called.

```cs
bool Eval(Char[] indicators)
```

#### Parameters

| Type | Parameter name | Description
| --- | --- | ---
| [Char\[\]](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.char) | indicators | An array of characters representing the indicators to be evaluated.

#### Returns

| Type | Description
| --- | ---
| [Boolean](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.boolean) | A boolean value that represents the result of the evaluation.
