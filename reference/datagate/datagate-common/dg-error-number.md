title: dgErrorNumber enum
---

Represents the different error numbers generated as a result of Acceler8DB or Datagate/400 server errors. These errors occur programmatically on the server computer to indicate a condition.  In general, these are "true errors", and only in a few cases do they signify a normal condition.
