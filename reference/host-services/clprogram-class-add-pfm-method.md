- <code>*CURLIB</code>: The current library for the
            job is searched. If no library is specified as the
            current library for the job, the QGPL library is
            used.

            to be searched.

#### Remarks
The following restrictions apply:

- The user must have object operational, object
        management or alter, and delete authority for the physical
        file that contains the member and execute authority to the
        library.
- If any of the access paths to the member are in use
        when this command is entered, or if the physical file
        member is in use, the command is not run.
- In multi-threaded jobs, this command is not thread safe
        for distributed files. This command is also not thread safe
        and fails for Distributed Data Management (DDM) files of
        type *SNA.
