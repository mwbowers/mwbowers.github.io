String. The qualified name of the physical file containing the member to clear. The name of the physical file can be qualified by one of the following library values:

- <code> ***LIBL** </code>: All libraries in the job's library
            list are searched until the first match is found. This
            is the default.
- *CURLIB: The current library for the
            job is searched. If no library is specified as the
            current library for the job, the QGPL library is
            used.

            to be searched.
- <code> *physical-file-name* </code>: Specify the name of the

        <dd>

String. The optional name of the physical file member within the *File* to clear. The name of the member can be:

            database file is used.

#### Remarks
The following restrictions apply:

- The user must have object operational and object
        management or alter and delete authority for the physical
        file that contains the member; and execute authority for the
        library.
- If any of the access paths to the member are in use
        when this command is entered, or if the physical file
        member is in use, the command is not run.
- An *EXCL lock is required on the member to clear
        it.
- In multi-threaded jobs, this command is not thread safe
        for distributed files. This command is also not thread safe
        and fails for Distributed Data Management (DDM) files of
        type *SNA.
