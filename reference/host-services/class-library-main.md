ASNA.Monarch Framework contains two assemblies &#8211; **ASNA.Monarch.WebDspF** and **ASNA.VisualRPG.Runtime** . ASNA.Monarch.WebDspF supports the Web Server Controls to facilitate the implementation of the semantics of DDS elements and support of Non-ASPX Display files ASNA.VisualRPG.Runtime supports the language capabilities of migrated applications.

#### Exceptions
The class library documentation lists the exceptions that each member throws along with a description of the condition under which it is thrown.

#### Thread Safety
All public static members (methods, properties, fields, and events) within ASNA.Monarch support concurrent access within a multi-threaded environment. Therefore, any ASNA Monarch static member can be simultaneously invoked from two threads without encountering race conditions, deadlocks, or crashes.

For all classes and structures in ASNA.Monarch, check the Thread Safety section in the Language Reference documentation to determine whether it is thread safe. If you want to use a class that is not thread-safe in a multi-threaded environment, you must wrap an instance of the class with code that supplies the necessary synchronization constructs.
