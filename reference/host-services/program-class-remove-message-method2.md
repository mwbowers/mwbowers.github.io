#### Remarks
**RemoveMessage** may be used to remove one or more messages placed on a program message queue by a call to [ SendProgramMessage](program-class-end-program-message-methods.html). Messages are removed from the program message queue identified by *pgmQ* . The particular messages to remove from the queue are identified by *messageKey* . 

*pgmQ* may either be specified as a program name, for direct access to a particular program queue, or as a location string, for indirect or relative access to a program queue associated with a particular invocation on the call stack. For indirect access, the value of *pgmQ* must be a string consisting of two string tokens, separated by one or more space characters. The second token indicates a program invocation, and must be either the name of a particular invocation, or the keyword "*", to indicate the caller's program invocation. The first token must be one of two values, "*SAME" or "*PRV", to indicate, respectively, the program queue of the current invocation, or the program queue of the invocation just prior to the named invocation on the call stack.

*messageKey* may be a value returned by a preceding call to **SendProgramMessage** . In this case, the message in the **SendProgramMessage** call is removed. Alternately, the value of *messageKey* may be the keyword "*ALL", indicating that all messages on the program message queue should be removed.
