## Remarks

C# Syntax for Enumerations provides a descriptive naming, such that when referencing a member, the name of the enumeration is included in the syntax.

 For example, to refer to Edit Code "D", you would enter:

 ```cs
 EditCodes.D
 ```
 Notes: 
 1. The `enum` member does not need the word `EditCode`, that is, to avoid duplication, like EditCodes.EditCode_D (or something like it).
 2. C# names do not allow the first letter to be a numeric value, then for Edit Code '3', the named is spelled out as EditCodes.Three.
